  <p>
    We will process such content in line with this Policy and any applicable consent requirements.
  </p>

  <h3>2.10 AI-Generated Content (AIGC) and Generative Features</h3>

<p>
  Some of our games or Services may include AI-powered or AIGC Content features. These may include in-game characters, items, levels, text, artwork, dialogue, effects, or other creative elements based on your inputs
  or your interactions within the game.
</p>

<p>Depending on the specific feature, we may process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text prompts, commands, or selections you input</li>
  <li>Images, avatars, or artwork you upload (if applicable)</li>
  <li>Voice or audio samples, if you explicitly enable microphone- or voice-based features</li>
  <li>Choices and interactions you make while using AI-powered features</li>
</ul>

<p>
  AI processing may occur on-device or on secure cloud servers operated by us or by our service providers.
  We use your prompts, inputs, and interactions solely to generate the requested in-game output, perform necessary
  safety checks, maintain AIGC quality, and protect against abuse. We do not use your Personal Data or AIGC inputs
  to train public or unrelated third-party AI models, nor do we sell AIGC-related data to advertisers.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to user-facing AIGC features, some of our internal game assets are also created using AI tools.
  These internally generated creatives may include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI-generated icons, UI elements, illustrations, and graphic artwork</li>
  <li>AI-generated photos, backgrounds, materials, and textures</li>
  <li>AI-generated sound effects, ambient audio, music, or character voices</li>
  <li>AI-assisted animations, procedural levels, or in-game environmental elements</li>
  <li>Other AI-enhanced creative assets used in game production</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These internal AIGC assets are produced without using any user Personal Data and are fully owned by LongReach AI.
  Unless explicitly permitted, users may not extract, reuse, or distribute AI-generated internal game assets outside of
  our Services.
</p>

<p>
  AIGC outputs may be automatically or manually reviewed for the purposes of safety, quality, moderation, and legal
  compliance. Outputs that are harmful, unlawful, or violate our policies may be modified, restricted, or removed.
  AIGC features may also be updated, limited, or discontinued at any time as necessary for safety or operational reasons.
</p>

  <h3>2.11 Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
  <p>
    We and our third-party advertising and analytics partners may use cookies and similar technologies (such as mobile SDKs)
    to provide, personalize, and analyze our Services and to display advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
    These technologies may:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify your device across apps and sites (for example, via an advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Measure ad views, clicks, and performance</li>
    <li>Help provide personalized advertising based on your interests and usage</li>
    <li>Prevent showing you ads for apps you already installed (where supported)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you wish to opt out of personalized advertising, please see the “Right to Opt-Out” section and the ad network

    other users may be able to see certain information (such as your first name, nickname, profile image, or in-game profile),
    as allowed by that platform and your settings.
  </p>

  <h3>5.3 Guest Users</h3>
  <p>
    If you play as a “guest” without connecting a social account, you may still appear in leaderboards or other in-game
    listings via a nickname or anonymized identifier, visible to other players.
  </p>

  <h3>5.4 Service Providers</h3>
  <p>
    We may engage third-party companies to perform services on our behalf (for example, analytics, hosting, AI processing,
    customer support, fraud prevention). These service providers may have access to your information solely to perform
    services for us and are not permitted to use it for other purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>5.5 Aggregated or De-Identified Information</h3>
  <p>
    We may share aggregated or de-identified information (which does not identify you personally) with third parties for
    purposes such as industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, or other similar business purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>5.6 Business Transfers</h3>
  <p>
    User information (including Personal Data) may be treated as a business asset. If we are involved in a merger,
    acquisition, asset sale, reorganization, bankruptcy, or similar event, your information may be transferred to the
    acquiring or successor entity as part of that transaction.
  </p>

  <h3>5.7 Protection of Us and Others</h3>
  <p>
    We may disclose information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

    or consent to such sharing via the Services.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Security of Your Information</h2>

  <p>
    We take reasonable physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect the information we collect from loss,
    misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmitting or storing data
    is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>

  <p>
    Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. Any information you provide to those third parties
    is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy. We are not responsible for the content, privacy, or security
    practices of those websites or services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>

  <p>
    All Personal Data collected via or by LongReach AI may be stored and processed in various countries, which may include
    but are not limited to Singapore, the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions where we or our service
    providers operate data centers or servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data protection laws vary from country to country. In some cases, the laws where your data is stored or processed may
    provide a different level of protection than the laws in your home jurisdiction. We take reasonable steps to ensure that
    your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy, including relying on Standard Contractual Clauses
    and other legal mechanisms for cross-border data transfers, where required.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using our Services and providing information to us, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your
    information in these locations.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Our Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly
    collect Personal Data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13
    (or under 16, where applicable), we will take steps to delete such information as soon as reasonably possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that your child has provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at

    You may have the right to request confirmation as to whether we process your Personal Data and, where applicable, a copy
    of such data.
  </p>

  <h3>10.2 Right to Correct (Rectification)</h3>
  <p>
    We try to keep the information we hold about you accurate and up to date. You may request correction of inaccurate or

  </p>

  <h3>10.4 Right to Opt-Out of “Sale” or Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
  <p>
    Some laws (such as the CCPA/CPRA) define “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information broadly, including certain transfers
    to third parties for targeted advertising. If applicable in your region, you may have the right to opt out of such
    “sales” or “sharing.”
  </p>
  <p>
    If you opt out, we will not “sell” or “share” your Personal Data with our advertising partners for targeted advertising
    as defined by applicable law. You may still see ads in our Apps, but they may be less relevant or based on contextual
    information only.
  </p>
  <p>You can also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset or limit your mobile advertising identifier using your device settings.</li>
    <li>Limit or disable cookies in your browser (for web-based components).</li>
    <li>Disconnect social or network accounts from our games, if applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>10.5 Right to Object or Restrict Processing</h3>
  <p>
    In certain cases, you may have the right to object to or request restrictions on the processing of your Personal Data,
    particularly where we rely on legitimate interests.
  </p>

  <h3>10.6 Right to Data Portability</h3>
  <p>
    In some jurisdictions, you may have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and
    machine-readable format, and to have that data transmitted to another controller, where technically feasible.
  </p>

  <h3>10.7 Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
  <p>
    Where we rely on your consent (for example for personalized ads or certain AIGC features), you may withdraw that consent
    at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
  </p>

  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:help@longreachai.net">help@longreachai.net</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your
    request as required by law.
